🗑️ Garbage Classification Using Transfer Learning

This project applies Transfer Learning to classify garbage images into categories using a deep learning model. The objective is to assist in automated waste segregation, improving waste management and recycling efficiency.
📌 Project Overview

The notebook leverages pre-trained CNN models (like MobileNetV2, ResNet50, etc.) to classify waste images. Transfer Learning enables faster training and better accuracy even with limited data.
👇 Tasks Performed:

    Dataset loading and preprocessing

    Image augmentation

    Transfer learning model setup

    Training and validation

    Accuracy & loss visualization

    Model evaluation and predictions

🛠️ Technologies Used

    Python 🐍

    TensorFlow / Keras

    OpenCV & Matplotlib

    NumPy

    Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset

    The dataset should include images categorized into folders (e.g., plastic/, paper/, glass/, etc.).

    Each folder corresponds to one waste category.

    Ensure a balanced number of images per class for better model performance.

🚀 How to Run

    Clone this repository or download the notebook.

    Install the dependencies:

    pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy opencv-python

    Prepare the dataset directory structure.

    Run the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible IDE.



📎 Future Work

    Convert model to TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment.

    Integrate into a real-time camera app.

    Deploy as a web service using Flask or FastAPI.
